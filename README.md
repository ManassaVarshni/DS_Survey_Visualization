# DS_Survey_Visualization

This year, as in 2017, 2018, and 2019 Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 20,036 responses!

This project targets the students who wish to get into the data science industry and working professionals who are looking to switch to data science. 

The visualizations were made with plotly and matplotlib.
